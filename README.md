# Covid19 Diary (by C-Lab)
A diary for **communication**, building **empathy**, and even faster **recovery**.

It is a web platform where covid19-confirmed people write and share the recovery process in a diary format until they recover.

Through various people's diaries, you can indirectly experience how Covid19 can affect your life today.

Take a look at the changes in the lives of Pre-Covid19 and Post-Covid19.

You can check your changes from specific health data.

The whole world is suffering from Covid19, economic activity stops, and someone's family dies of Corona. Nevertheless, looking at the current society, many people do not seem to know the seriousness of Covid19.

To solve the above problems, Covid19 Diary gives people awareness of Covid19 and gives strength to many people who are struggling with this Pandemic.
